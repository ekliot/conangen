Post-Mortem
---

This project was an excellent learning experience, and provided the foundation for a journey in full-stack development.

Perhaps I'll get back to this, however there is not much incentive here. For everything I learnt, what I learnt most of all are my limits, and that back-end development just doesn't have that *je ne sais quoi* for me that front-end development does. Ultimately, in hindsight this was an overly-ambitious foray into full-stack web development, especially for my first.

Coming away from this, I'm able to take what went well (designing an intuitive interface to guide uninitiated players through a relatively complex RPG character creation system), and grow from what went poorly (trying swallowing an elephant in one bite by designing a relational database with a complexity to match its domain). This experience provided context for the things I learnt in future database management classes, and planted a seed for future interface design and development. What more could I ask for?
