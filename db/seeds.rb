Eventually, you were found out and the angry eyes of the villagers were terrible to behold. Were you punished, and did you ever redeem yourself?" },

He had come to take taxes for the fifth time, but there was no food or other wealth to be had. When he learned he could take nothing from you and your kin, he just stopped, as if his soul had given up, onwards to some other place of plenitude. The horse was short work for the butcher and you were sent south to find someone to buy the man’s sword. Did you find a buyer? Did you take the profits home? " },

As water became a luxury, some in your village looked at the soft flesh of the masters and contemplated a different type of prey. As the knife sunk deep into the land-owner’s agent rain began to fall. You looked on in horror, as desperation revealed its ugliest side. You were forced to ask yourself the hardest question. How hungry were you?" }

What did you get a taste for, and does it tempt you still?" },

    { name: "Nights of Sweet Silence", trait: "Hedonist", description: "You remember the hills where you rested, sandwiched between the grasses and scented herbs of the wild. The days were tender and the nights were long. You spent more time at play than at work, and gained memories that still lighten your heart, even in leaner years. Of these, what is your fondest memory?" },

She was determined to make you a masterful wolf hunter, even if she had to beat the lessons into you. Despite all the training, you only remember hearing howls once.

When the plague had passed, only one in five lived. The herd was doomed. Your cattle master drove the remainder to town, where they were slaughtered and the money divided amongst you. In the morning, you found him hanged with a lock of his wife’s hair still woven around his fingers. Just the night before he had seemed so wise. What was the last thing he said to you?" },

At first, they were the nuisance they had always been, but as the snows grew deeper the tracks got larger. Somewhere in the forest, a great wolf was gathering a pack larger than any seen before. Foresters would go in gangs to gather firewood, but you quickly found yourself lost. In the snow while carrying a bundle of wet branches, you saw it and looked into its eyes. To this day those eyes haunt you. What did you see and why did it let you live?" },

In hushed tones, the old men of your village whispered a word that carried with it a weight of dread… “Raiders!” The fences were surrounded with traps and the able-bodied in your village were set as guards. On the third night the raiders struck. Half the herd was stolen and fifteen were placed upon the pyre. Finally, it was time for the young to speak and your voice joined many. What did you do, and what was the cost?" }

You were a noble in all but name, but it did not last. Now the old man is dead and the monopolies returned to the prince who increases the taxation on your properties, to ruinous amounts.

You were young enough that they didn’t pay you much mind unless you were serving wine. Consequently, you learned a great deal that the visitors didn’t want your aunt to know.

At first, mercenaries were hired, but they deserted and joined the bandits in their plunder. Then, soldiers were borrowed from the king but the taxes on that service were exorbitant.

Your uncle offended one of the more powerful courtiers, and the courtier made it his mission to destroy your family. By the time the courtier was done, your family’s name was in ruin. The king granted your rivals monopolies that blocked your goods from entry to the larger cities, and bandits harassed your caravans. When the fire took your family’s estate, you were left thoroughly dispossessed. Now that you’ve started to rise, you must consider your options.

You knew yourselves dead, but you had to hold out so that the warriors would stand an even chance against the horde. The fight was brutal. The corpses of horses, soldiers, and other makeshift barricades piled up in front of your line, turning the fight from massed battle to deadly skirmish. Fully half of your number was slain, but you gave better than you got and it was them that routed. When the rest of your army emerged from the forest road, they found boys turned into veterans.
